Part 2: Pneumonia Prediction Dataset

Data is placed in folders with relative paths:
- Project1\data\chest_xray\train\PNEUMONIA
- Project1\data\chest_xray\train\NORMAL
- Project1\data\chest_xray\val\PNEUMONIA
- Project1\data\chest_xray\val\NORMAL
- Project1\data\chest_xray\test\PNEUMONIA
- Project1\data\chest_xray\test\NORMAL

Q1: To run Exploratory Data Analysis run Project1\code\part2Task1.py. This script includes plotting some samples. 
Q2: Everything connected with this task is in folder Project1\code\CNN. Most important file is main.py which calls train function.
Q3: Everything connected with this task is in folder Project1\code\integrated_gradients. CNN model that performed best is renamed to our_model.pth. To run the code and see plotted images, run Project1\code\integrated_gradients\main.py.
